            This classes that I am taking this semester are of very high quality. Previously while in classes such as data structures and java 2 it felt like I was just coding things that are already created in something i should just import. This semester howerver, my classes Introduction to software engineering and Developing advanced webapplications class make me feel like im actually creating something worthwhile. In addition even though this is not the case with my systems programing concepts class, that class provides intersting problems that lead me to having a much better uderstanding of code while leaving me with great satisfaction after completeting the work.
