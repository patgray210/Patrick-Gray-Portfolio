            I have been playing beach volleyball for almost three years now and recently was lucky enough to run into a high teir coach who liked me and was willing to help me out.

            Height is a pretty big deal in beach voleyball. Althought I am taller than a lot of people 6'0 is still small in the big picture. Espcally locally, being 6'0 is tall enough to perform well and place reasonablly well; however, if I i want to be the best i simply ca not do that as the blocker. Every now and then I see a players who is not only good but massive and feel a little jelous, but there is nothing anyone can change about that. For another class I had to make an infographic and I chose to display the difference in hit percentages based on height for Male players in the proffesional fivb and avp tournaments. So not only can i not block well but my scoring potential is going to be statistaclly lower.

            Outside of playing I still try to find ways that i can do things that will be benifcail. I try to work out lightly three times a week but it is difficult because i play nearly six days a week
