                I have been playing beach volleyball for almost three years now and recently was lucky enough to run into a high teir coach who liked me and was willing to help me out. Despite playing for nearly three years up until now I simply used trial and error to learn to play, but now having a coach who tells me the correct and proper techniques is a massive improvement to how fast I can get better.

                Height is a pretty big deal in beach voleyball. Althought I am taller than a lot of people 6'0 is still small in the big picture. Espcally locally, being 6'0 is tall enough to perform well and place reasonablly well; however, if I i want to be the best i simply ca not do that as the blocker. Every now and then I see a players who is not only good but massive and feel a little jelous, but there is nothing anyone can change about that. For another class I had to make an infographic and I chose to display the difference in hit percentages based on height for Male players in the proffesional fivb and avp tournaments. So not only can i not block well but my scoring potential is going to be statistaclly lower.

                Outside of playing I still try to find ways that I can do things that will be benifcail. I try to work out lightly three times a week but it is difficult because i play nearly six days a week. There is a vertical jump bible that is out there on the internet that gives a very detailed breakdown on how to improve your jumping. It has different sections and suggested excercise plans based of your current vertical and abilitly to lift wieghts. I have found that gaining muscle is very difficult for me. I used an online calculator to estimate how much i would need to eat to gain a significant amount of a weight over a given time period and it was over 4000 calories a day which is very difficult for me to acheive consitantly as a college student who cannot cook.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class='bg-yellow'>
                Volleyball is something great that i like to enjoy while taking a break from coding, these were just some of my thoughts and feelings on topics related to the sport that I love.
