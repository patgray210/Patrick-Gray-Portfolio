this is the link to my first blog post.
For the blog I made the sections and images fluid so that they would be responsive.
I added a background pattern but there is a sliver that starts too early that i havent spent extensive time trying to remove
I made the three sections bring you to the corresponding sections
I made the button in the top right bring you back to the portfolio page
I added some gifs but i did not write the lines myself the gif website did that.
